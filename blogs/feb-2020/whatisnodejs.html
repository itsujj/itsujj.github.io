                  Gone are the days when we were limited to use Javascript in web browsers only. 
                  Thanks to <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl" target="__blank">Ryan Dahl</a></span> now we can use
                  JavaScript outside of the its conventional runtime environment. So, how Ryan made it happen? To 
                  understand this let us understand what JavaScript is and how it works.
                  <br><br>
                  In 1995, Netscape contracted <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" target="__blank">Brendan Eich</a></span> 
                  to design a language that can be seamlessly integrated with the web to. In a matter of just 10 days, 
                  Brendan created a langugae that would later become JavaScript.
                  <br><br>
                  JavaScript, as we now know, is an interpreted programming language which means unlike Java, JavaScript's
                  source code isn't complied into binary code prior to execution. So, how does the browser understand the language?
                  Well, that happens with the help of a javacript engine which is responsible for translating the written code
                  into machine code and executes the translation on CPU. Each of the browser we now know has their own javacript
                  engine, for example, Chrome has V8, Mozilla has SpiderMonkey, Safari has Nitro and Edge has Chakra.
                  <br><br>
                  Nodejs uses the same concept of javascript engine and makes it possible to run javascript outside of the web 
                  environment. It uses Chrome's open source javacript engine, V8, for just-in-time compilation. With the help of 
                  Nodejs, developers who are proficient at using Javascript can now use the language which now can work on a 
                  multitude of different environment. Though Nodejs is primarily used as server side technology but one can also 
                  develop applications that would run just fine on desktop, embedded systems, etc.
                  <br><br>
                  In short and simple term, Nodejs is a framework that helps Javascript programmers develop applications that can 
                  also run outside the web browsers.
