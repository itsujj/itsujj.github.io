                    I am a fullstack web developer based in Hyderabad. Earlier, I worked in advertising & marketing and prior 
                    to that I worked in industrial engineering. It took a lot of soul searching to be what I am today. Some might 
                    call me a career-hopper, I like to call myself an ambitious explorer. I always liked the idea of problem 
                    solving but was not so dedicated about pursuing it before as I am now. Nothing happened in solitary, it was a 
                    fusion of the last work environment and the support of my awesome family (modest parents and a loving sister)
                    and my wonderful girlfriend that I am now doing something I should've done earlier. Lets just say, better 
                    late than never.
                    <br><br>
                    There is so much I can tell you about me, so many stories and experiences but I am keeping those personal 
                    things to our brunches. It's more fun to tell those in person. With this website, I would mainly 
                    like to brush up my concepts, share what I have learnt so far, and would like to learn more to come technologies in the field of 
                    internet, programming and product development. Cheers!
                  </p>
